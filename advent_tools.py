    that is to make a unique string representation of each step, and use
    that to hash and compare the object. That's what's used by default here,
    so that only __str__ must be implemented by the child object. But if
    that doesn't work, just override __hash__ and __eq__ directly.

    The second requirement is to implement possible_next_states,
    which provides the edges of the graphs connected to this node, or state.
    That's where the real meat of the problem will end up.

    The third requirement is to implement is_final, which tells the BFS
    search when it has reached the destination node.

    Notes for optimization of breadth-first searches:
        - If two states are equivalent in some way, as in the steps required
            don't depend on any differences between them, make their string
            representations the same, so that they compare as equal
